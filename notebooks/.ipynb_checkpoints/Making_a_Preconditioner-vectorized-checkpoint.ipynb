    "## 2. Stationary iterative methods as preconditioners\n",
    "A preconditioner reduces the condition number of the coefficient matrix, thereby making it easier to solve. We dont explicitly need a matrix because we dont access the elements by index, coefficient matrix or preconditioner. What we do need is the action of the matrix on a vector. That is, we need only the matrix-vector product. The coefficient matrix can be defined as a function that takes in a vector and returns the matrix vector product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any stationary method has an iteration matrix associated with it. This is easily seen for Jacobi or GS methods. This iteration matrix can be used as a preconditioner. But we dont explicitly need it. The stationary iterative method for solving an equation can be written as a Richardson iteration. When the initial guess is set to zero and one iteration is performed, what you get is the action of the preconditioner on the RHS vector. That is, we get a preconditioner-vector product, which is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This allows us to use any blackbox stationary iterative method as a preconditioner**\n",
    "\n",
    "To repeat, if there is a stationary iterative method that you want to use as a preconditioner, set the initial guess to zero, set the RHS to the vector you want to multiply the preconditioner with and perform one iteration of the stationary method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the multigrid V-cycle as a preconditioner this way. We cant use FMG because it is not an iterative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix as a function can be defined using **LinearOperator** from **scipy.sparse.linalg**. It gives us an object which works like a matrix in-so-far as the product with a vector is concerned. It can be used as a regular 2D numpy array in multiplication with a vector. This can be passed to CG(), GMRES() or BiCGStab() as a preconditioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a symmetric preconditioner would be nice because it will retain the symmetry if the original problem is symmetric and we can still use CG. If the preconditioner is not symmetric CG will not converge, and we would have to use a more general solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code for defining a V-Cycle preconditioner. The default is one V-cycle. In the V-cycle, the defaults are one pre-sweep, one post-sweep. "
